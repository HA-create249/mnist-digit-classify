# MNIST Digit Classification with Neural Networks

This project demonstrates the implementation of a neural network for classifying handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a benchmark in the field of machine learning, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each sized 28x28 pixels. ([Wikipedia][1])

## Project Overview

The core of this project is the `mnist_nn.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook, which outlines the process of building, training, and evaluating a neural network model for digit recognition. The implementation leverages popular Python libraries for data handling and model development.

## Features

* **Data Preprocessing**: Normalization and reshaping of input data to suit the neural network's requirements.
* **Model Architecture**: A feedforward neural network constructed using Keras with TensorFlow backend.
* **Training**: Model training with appropriate loss functions and optimizers.
* **Evaluation**: Assessment of model performance on the test dataset.([Wikipedia][1])

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have the following libraries installed:

* Python 3.x
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* NumPy
* Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```



### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HA-create249/mnist-digit-classify.git
   ```



2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd mnist-digit-classify
   ```



3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```



4. Open and run the `mnist_nn.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Results

The trained neural network achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset, demonstrating effective learning and generalization capabilities. Detailed performance metrics and visualizations are provided within the notebook.

## Dataset

The MNIST dataset is publicly available and can be accessed through various machine learning libraries. For more information, refer to the [Wikipedia page on MNIST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).([Wikipedia][1])
